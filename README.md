# Restaurant Reviews App(Stage 1)


## Description
This project was created as part of the Udacity Front End Web Developer Nanodegree. The project is published at: https://musengya.github.io/restaurantreviewapp/.

### Instructions
This project is a static webpage that lacks accessibility and should be converted to a responsive one to be used on different sized displays and should also be accessible for screen reader use. A service worker should be added to begin the process of creating a seamless offline experience for the users.

## How to Run the Application
* Navigate to https://github.com/musengya/restaurantreviewapp.
* Click Clone or download.
* Copy the URL provided.
* Open your command line or Terminal application and enter the directory where you would like to copy the repository. This can be anywhere in your local file system, like your home directory. For example:
```
 cd ~/
 ```
* Clone the repository by replacing with clone URL you copied in the previous step. The repository will be cloned into a new directory in this location.
 git clone https://github.com/musengya/restaurantreviewapp.git
 * In this folder, start up a simple HTTP server to serve up the site files on your local computer. Python has some simple tools to do this, and you don't even need to know Python. For most people, it's already installed on your computer. 
 * In a terminal, check the version of Python you have: `python -V`. If you have Python 2.x, spin up the server with `python -m SimpleHTTPServer 8000` (or some other port, if port 8000 is already in use.) For Python 3.x, you can use `python3 -m http.server 8000`. If you don't have Python installed, navigate to Python's [website](https://www.python.org/) to download and install the software.
 * With your server running, visit the site: `http://localhost:8000`
